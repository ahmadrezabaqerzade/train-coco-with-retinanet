This project involves training a RetinaNet model with two different backbones (ResNet50 and MobileNetV2) on the COCO dataset. RetinaNet is an object detection model that is used for various applications such as object detection in images, vehicle detection, face detection, and more. This model has advantages such as high accuracy, high speed, and the ability to detect objects in different sizes of images.

In this project, the COCO dataset is first divided into training and testing sets, and then the RetinaNet model is trained using two different backbones. One of the backbones used in this project is ResNet50, which is a 50-layer convolutional neural network with an effective architecture for extracting image features. The other is MobileNetV2, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network that uses techniques such as depthwise separable convolution to reduce the number of parameters and increase speed.

In this project, the PyTorch library is used to implement the RetinaNet model, and the model is trained in a dynamic and accessible environment using Google Colab. Finally, the RetinaNet model's accuracy and performance with two different backbones on the COCO dataset are evaluated using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and loss function.
